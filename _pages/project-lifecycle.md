title: Project Lifecyle
description: Every civic tech project goes through different stages. Here's a simple breakdown of how your project might evolve. Remember, these stages aren't a strict rulebook. You might jump back and forth between them as you learn new things. The key is to keep talking to the people you're helping and be ready to change course if needed.  Don't feel like you have to do everything perfectly. Start where you can, and use the parts that make sense for your project. The goal is to create something useful for your community, not to follow a perfect process.

# 3.1 Discover

Get to know your community and the problem you're trying to solve. Talk to people, observe, and gather information.

This is where you learn about your community and the problem you're trying to solve. You'll do research to understand people's needs, how the community works, and what's already out there.

Stay open-minded during this phase. Your goal is to learn, not to jump to solutions right away.

# 3.3 Develop

Come up with ideas and start building. Try things out, get feedback, and keep improving.

This is where you come up with ideas, build quick versions of your solution, and test them out. You'll keep improving your ideas based on what you learn.

This phase is all about learning and improving. Don't worry if your first idea isn't perfect - that's normal!

:::tip
Try to involve users throughout this phase, not just for testing. Consider having sessions where users help create and refine ideas.
:::

# 3.5 Evolve

Decide on the next steps for your project. This could mean growing it, handing it off, or winding it down based on how it's working and what the community needs.

Once your project is out in the world, it might take different paths. This phase is about recognizing when your project needs to change direction and how to handle that change.

Change is a normal part of any project's lifecycle. Be open to different outcomes and focus on what's best for your community.

:::tip
Regular check-ins on your project's direction can help you spot the need for change early
:::

## Why it matters:

- Projects often need to adapt as community needs change
- Some projects fulfill their purpose and need to wind down
- Others might be ready to grow beyond your original team
- Understanding these possibilities helps you plan and make tough decisions

## Key activities:

1. Assess your project's current state
   - Look at usage data, community feedback, and resource requirements
   - Consider if the project is still meeting its original goals
2. Explore different paths
   - Continuing: Keep running and improving the project
   - Scaling: Grow the project to serve more people or address new needs
   - Handing off: Transfer the project to another organization or government
   - Hibernating: Put the project on pause if it's not currently needed
   - Retiring: Wind down the project if it's completed its purpose
3. Plan for transitions
   - If handing off, document everything clearly for the new owners
   - If retiring, communicate clearly with users and archive the work
   - If scaling, consider what new resources or partnerships you'll need
4. Learn and share
   - Reflect on what worked well and what you'd do differently
   - Share your experiences with the civic tech community
