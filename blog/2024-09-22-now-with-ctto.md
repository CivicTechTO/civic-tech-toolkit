Happy to announce that the instance of the Civic Tech toolkit project has been ported over to Civic Tech Torontoâ€™s GitHub instance! And, configured to build with GitHub actions!

Phew, glad thatâ€™s done! ðŸ˜…

The GitHub repo is up at [github.com/CivicTechTO/civicsaurus](https://github.com/CivicTechTO/civicsaurus).

On the Configuration: Given that a Vercel configuration with the complexities of the GitHub organization and continuity risks this GitHub Pages infrastructure is a stellar solution to keep the maintenance of this site up and running.

Huzzah!
